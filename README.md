This is the repository for assignment 9.\
The assignment has a web app (App) and an API that uses MongoDB to authenticate users. To run this project we first perform

```
npm install
```
in both App and API folders. For the nest step we use 

```
npm start
```
first in the API folder and then on the App side. This is because the API needs to be using port 3000 for the system to work properly. **Note:** The npm app and api aren't melded properly and require seperate CMD/terminals to run them properly.
